# 🖼️ Image Editing Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
The image editing functionality was not working properly - users couldn't save changes to background images or the 3 cards section images, and the save buttons weren't appearing. Only text editing was working correctly.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**
Image editing now shows save (✓) and cancel (✕) buttons, just like text editing, and properly integrates with the page save system to show change counts.
